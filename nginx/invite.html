      <h1>You've Been Invited!</h1>
      <p>You've been invited to join the accounting platform at <strong id="domain"></strong>.</p>
      <p>To get started, just click the logo above. Your browser will walk you through a few quick steps.</p>
      <p><strong>Don't worry</strong> - it's safe and easy. You won't need to remember a password!</p>
      <h2>What Happens When You Click?</h2>
      <p>Clicking the button will create something called a <strong>WebAuthn Resident Key</strong> on your device. This
        is a special kind of login method that's more secure than a password.</p>
      <p>You might be asked to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use your fingerprint or face recognition</li>
        <li>Enter your device PIN</li>
        <li>Tap a security key (if you have one)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This helps make sure it's really you logging in - and keeps your account safe from hackers.</p>
      <h2>So, What is WebAuthn?</h2>
      <p><strong>WebAuthn</strong> is short for "Web Authentication." It's a new, high-security way to log in without
        using passwords. Instead, it uses your device's built-in security — like Face ID, fingerprint, or a security
        key.</p>
      <p>Why it's awesome:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No password to remember or get stolen</li>
        <li>Super quick logins after setup</li>
        <li>Much safer than traditional logins</li>
      </ul>
